This project consists of two parts:
 - An asset converter for the game "The Settlers 2", which converts all its assets into common formats (.png, .ogg, etc.)
 - An re-implementation of the game itself

At this time the asset converter is fully functional, but for the game I only have a basic and incomplete renderer.
